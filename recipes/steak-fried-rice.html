            <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Pat flank steak dry with a paper towel. Cut into bite-sized pieces and transfer to a medium bowl. Season with 1 teaspoon sugar, salt, and pepper. Add cornstarch and toss until well coated.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add eggs and scramble using a rubber spatula, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove eggs to a dish.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon oil and 1/2 of the meat to the wok. Increase heat to high and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add 1 teaspoon oil and repeat with remaining meat.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the wok and reduce heat to medium-low. Add onion, garlic, and ginger; cook until onions begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add peas and water; cook until peas are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cooked rice, breaking it up with a spatula, and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, remaining 4 teaspoons sugar, vinegar, and sesame oil. Add meat and scrambled eggs, toss together, and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
